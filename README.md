# ZS_YoungDataScientistChallenge2017
### About 
The third edition of the pan India Annual Data Science Challenge organised by ZS Associates, meant for 3rd and 4th year college students, this event aimed at providing us with a sneak peak into the kind of work done at ZS. 

### Result
Out of the roughly <b>600</b> students who had participated, I secured the rank of <b>16</b>.

### Competition
There were two phases involved : 
<ul>
  <li><b>Online</b> : In a 72 hour window, we had to solve a predictive problem. A dataset of the various treatments and diagnosis taken up by different patients at a hospital was given which spanned over 3 years, and it was required of us to predict the next 10 treatments that the patient will have to invest in, in the upcoming year.
  </li><br>
  <li><b>Offline</b> : Top 30 students from the Online Hackathon were invited to the ZS Office where we were given insights into the works of ZS. This was followed by an onsite hackathon where the training data consisted of remarks / comments that were either made by patients of a hostipal or the general public. The problem statement was to identify the comments that were made by the Patients in the test set.</li>
</ul>
